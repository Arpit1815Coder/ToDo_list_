# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


#Testing Guidance

Add Tasks: Try adding tasks with different text inputs.

Mark as Complete: Click on tasks to toggle their completion status.

Remove Tasks: Click the remove button next to tasks.

Filter Tasks: Use the filter dropdown to view all, completed, or incomplete tasks.

Sort Tasks: Use the sort dropdown to sort tasks by date or alphabetically.

Persistent Data: Refresh the page to ensure tasks persist using localStorage.
